Welcome to my mini project

I start this project for fun as a side project. I find that it was a good playground to learn (drag-and-drop js API) and reinforce some basics (Asynchrone request, CLIENT-SERVER architecture, create Docker container).

Feel free to run my mini project !

prerequisite :

* download Docker
* clone project

start project :

* execute shell CMD 'start-app.sh'
* open any web browser at 'http://localhost:8000'

You should now see my little application.
Have fun !

PS1 : Any comment about how to improve my code is more than welcome.

PS2 : You could have trouble running docker cmd inside 'strat-app.sh' script. If so prefix script with sudo 
      (cf. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
